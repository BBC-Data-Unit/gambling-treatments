In July 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53351411) treatments for dozens of people with gambling addictions across Great Britain were paused as NHS staff were redeployed due to coronavirus.

Ex-gambling addict Bray Ash, who once lost his entire student loan in a day, said the return of professional sport left people at risk.

BBC research revealed some NHS staff who helped people with addiction were moved to other roles during the pandemic.

NHS trusts said they had to redeploy staff to "where the need was greatest".

It came after The BBC Shared Data Unit [reported in May 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52633355) that search interest in online casinos had hit an all-time high in the UK since lockdown began. Search interest had risen again by July 2020.
